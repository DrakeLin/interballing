# InterBalling

## Inspiration
Our team member Jonathan is always complaining about losing fantasy basketball matchups, so we decided to work on something to help him out. 

## What it does
InterBalling is a web app that displays season-by-season stats of every active player in the NBA, with the planned functionality of predicting future performance using InterSystems AutoML. 

## How we built it
As a source of truth, we used nba_api. We used InterSystems for database storage and ObjectScript middleware, and React for the frontend to display the stats!

## Challenges we ran into
As somewhat beginner coders, this was our first full web app that we've worked on. We ran into a lot of beginner errors, but we're really glad we worked on this!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working with InterSystems tech was really cool and we're happy to have had the chance to work on it!

## What we learned
We learned a ton about working with InterSystems! 

## What's next for InterBalling
We can quickly and easily add functionality for predicting future player performance over the next week, next month, and next year using InterSystems AutoML! We really wanted to build this in time for the end of the hackathon, but we unfortunately ran out. It will be a great demonstration of AutoML's capability, hopefully with some algorithm similar to regression!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
